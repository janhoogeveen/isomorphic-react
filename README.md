# What is this?

It's an example of a web application made in React using Express as a webserver. This way we can pre-render our React components on the webserver and as soon as the client-side code has been downloaded take over and make it a single-page application.

## Benefits of this approach for our clients:
* The whole website works without JavaScript enabled
* Works when we're on slow connections (Train/Hotspots/Foreign countries)
* Bots can crawl the content again, just like old times (essential for SEO)

## How to run it?
Clone the repo and do this:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Now go to 0.0.0.0:3000 and that's it!

## What needs to be done before we can use this in production websites?
* Set up a good example of a routing config
* Determine if the current 404 solution is reliable
* Add styling to the project
  * Find out if we can use Sass for this
  * Find out if we can use PostCSS with this
  * Find out if we can use Autoprefixer with this
  * Find out where we should save and deploy static files (images/stylesheets/fonts/downloads)
* Find out how to deploy an app like this and seperate production mode from development mode
* Add unit testing framework to the application
* Add unit testing examples to the application
